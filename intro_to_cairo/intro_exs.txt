Exercise
1. Write nondeterministic pseudocode for proving that the equation x**7 + x + 18 = 0 has a solution.

2. Write nondeterministic pseudocode for proving that the same equation has at least two different solutions.

1. 
    - magically guess the value of x
    - compute x in the equation and make sure the result is equal to 0

2. 
    - magically guess the values of 2 different x's
    - compute the 2 different values of x in the equation and make sure the result is equal to 0
